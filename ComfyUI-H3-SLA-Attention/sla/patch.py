"""Wire the block-sparse kernel into MiniMax-H3 attention, at inference time.

The hook is ``transformer_options["optimized_attention_override"]``, read by
``wrap_attn`` in ``comfy/ldm/modules/attention.py``. H3 reaches it from its one
attention call site, ``comfy/ldm/minimax/model.py:172``.

The legacy ``set_model_attn1_patch`` hook does *not* work here: it is the
SD-UNet cross-attention path, and H3 is a DiT that never consults it. A patch
installed that way reports success and silently does nothing -- which is the
failure this whole module exists to avoid, hence the invocation counter below.

Layout at the call site: q/k/v arrive ``[1, 56, S, 128]`` bf16 with
``skip_reshape=True``, ``mask=None``, RoPE already applied. H3 does not pass
``skip_output_reshape``, so we owe it ``[1, S, 7168]`` back.
